# About
- An offline video player app with limited functionality.
- Has a Home page, Player page, User Profile page and a Form to edit the user info.
- The app is a very simple yet working prototype of what could be a video player if built with flutter.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repo onto your machine.
- <code>./lib/main.dart</code> is the entry point for the build. Start from there and play around.
- Add videos/images in the <code>./assets/</code> directory to play those videos with this build.

## Functions
- Has limited features. You choose a video from the Home page and get a random video played in the Player page.
- Go to User Profile page and add details via the Form by clicking the FloatingButton.
- The details once entered can be viewed in your Profile page.

### Misc
- The Images and Videos added in the build are just for representation purposes and are not related to each other.
- [Issue]((https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/47281))The APK didn't work on my smartphone but runs well on the emulator, so
I'd to revert the push made earlier.
